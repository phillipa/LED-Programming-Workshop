# LED-Programming-Workshop
Documentation and resources for running a middle/high school level workshop on programming LEDs.

Materials developed by Phillipa Gill & Ivan Lee. Based on materials by Ben Marlin. 

Please contact us if you have questions or want to contribute edits to the materials.

The workshop is designed to use an Arduino Uno with a short length of AdaFruit Neopixel LEDs. 

* Documentation contains instructions for the lab exercises

* Labs contains solutions to the different labs

* Presentations includes introduction presentations as well as a training slide deck for volunteers.

* Software contains the relevant software add-ons. Specifically, we have modified the ArduBlock visual programming tool to include basic functions for manipulating LEDs. You can use this version by copying the ArduBlock Jar File (e.g., ardublock-beta-GirlsInc-v2.jar) into the Arduino/tools/ArduBlockTool/tool directory. Once you have done this, you can see the ‘ArduBlock’ block tool in the tool menu in your Arduino program.
